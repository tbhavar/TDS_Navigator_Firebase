## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: The user requested branding color, steel blue (#4285F4) suggests reliability. This primary color is for buttons, active states, and key interactive elements.
- Background color: A very light, desaturated steel blue (#F0F4FF) provides a subtle backdrop, visually of the same hue as the primary, without distracting from the content.
- Accent color: A contrasting light indigo (#5072A6), approximately 30 degrees to the 'left' on the color wheel, highlights important information, and complements the overall color scheme. This is appropriate for calls to action.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif, to match the existing branding and for a professional tech-forward appearance.
- Body font: 'Inter', sans-serif, complements 'Space Grotesk' and maintains a clean, readable design.
- Use financial and legal icons that complement the information. Prefer simple, outlined icons.
- Implement subtle animations, such as fade-in effects and loading spinners.
